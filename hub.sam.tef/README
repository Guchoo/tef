RUNNING THE EXAMPLES

This is an Eclipse PDE Project featuring two EMF based Editors. The first is an
editor for ecore-Models (file extension ecore). The second is an editor
featuring live-parsing. This editor is for simple Integer/+/*/()-expressions
like (1+2)*3 (file extension expressions).

You have to run eclipse 3.2 with the newest EMF installed.

THE ECORE EDITOR

To compile and use the ecore-editor you have to create a source-project for the
standard tree-based ecore editor (org.eclipse.emf.ecore.editor) and replace
src/org/eclipse/emf/ecore/editor/presentation/EcoreEditor.java in the ecore
project with resources/codepieces/EcoreEditor.java from the TEF-project. It
contains a little hack to let both editors (the tree-based and the TEF-editor)
share the same editing domain. This lets both editors edit the same model at
the same time.

All TEF-editors define 3 edit actions: 

* the normal code-complete action from eclipse (ctrl-space)
* Text Editing / Insert an Element
* Text Editing / Delete an Element

The two latter action have still to be bind by you
(Window/Preferences/General/Keys) in the eclipse that actually runs the plugin.
The delete action deletes the actually marked elements, the insert actions
opens a code-completion dialog to choose an element to insert.  The normal
code-completion action can be used to change an existing element.

THE EXPRESSION EDITOR

Here you can actually type the model, using live-parsing. Anything that is
marked yellow is not yet in the model and exists only on the parse stack.
